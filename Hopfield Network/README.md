# Objective:

Understand the working of Hopfield network and use it for solving some interesting combinatorial problems

# Problems:

- For the sample code given, find out the amount of error (in bits) tolerable for each of the stored patterns.
- Setup the energy function for Eight-rook problem and solve the same using Hopfield network. Give reasons for choosing specific weights for network.
- Solve a TSP (travelling salesman problem) of 10 cities with a Hopfield network. How many weights do we need for the network?
