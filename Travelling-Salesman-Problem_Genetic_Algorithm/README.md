# Learning Objective:

Non-deterministic Search | Genetic Algorithm
For problems with large search spaces, randomized search becomes a meaningful option given partial/ full-information about the domain. Genetic algorithm is a randomized search method guided by fitness function (similar to heuristic function).

# Problem:

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a hard problem, and is simple to state. Given a graph in which the nodes are locations of cities, and edges are labelled with the cost of travelling between cities(or randomly generate 20 cities and the distance between them), find a cycle containing each city exactly once, such that the total cost of the tour is as low as possible.
