# AI Model and Algorithm

In simple layman’s terms, a model is like a Vending Machine, which given an input (money), will give you some output (a soda can maybe).

An algorithm is a mathematical technique. An algorithm is derived by statisticians and mathematicians for a particular task i.e. in our case prediction. 

Algorithms in machine learning were derived many years ago. Only when they were implemented in the form of a code in a computer, the algorithms’ utility increased to a very great extent since the computers can handle high computation very easily.



## Roadmap 

I would be improving the repository with more 
The array of problems the businesses face is huge, and the variety of ML models used to solve these problems is quite wide, as some algorithms are better at dealing with certain types of problems than the others. 

The “no free lunch” problem is the AI/ML industry adaptation of the age-old “no one-size-fits-all” problem. To get the clear understanding of what every type of ML models is good for, my future roadmap to work on following most common and  popular AI algorithms:

1. Linear regression - March 2020
2. Logistic regression - April 2020
3. Linear discriminant analysis - May 2020
4. Decision trees - June 2020
5. Naive Bayes - July 2020
6. K-Nearest Neighbors - August 2020
7. Learning vector quantization - September 2020
8. Support vector machines - October 2020
9. Bagging and random forest - November 2020
10. Deep neural networks - December 2020

New year new things will come...
