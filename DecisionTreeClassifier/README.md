# Learning Objective:

Construction and evaluation of identification (decision) tree classifier.

# Problem:

- Randomly select 60 percent of labelled data (from each class) for constructing the tree (training). Test for the rest of 40 percent data. Find out the accuracy of the classification tree with the help of confusion matrix and F-score. Use the entropy measure for selection of attribute.
- Repeat the above exercise 20 times. Calculate the average accuracy of classification.
- Repeat steps 1 and 2 with Gini index as a measure for selection of attribute.
- Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3 considering 70 and 80 percent data (random selection) for training.
