# Objective:
To understand the concept of confidence interval.

# Problem Statement:
Generate 100 random Gaussian samples with mean equal to 5 and standard deviation equal to 2. For all the sample create the 90% confidence interval and show that out of 100 samples mean=5 lies in aroung 90 of those samples.

# Inference:
We often get confused with the concept of confidence interval and think that 90% means that there is 0.9 probability of population mean to lie in the confidence interval of its sample, but that's incorrect. The 90% confidence interval states that if we draw 100 samples from the population then 90 of those sample's confidence interval will contain the population mean.

### Note:
To understand the code you need have basics of the probablity and how to calculate the confidence interval of any sample.
